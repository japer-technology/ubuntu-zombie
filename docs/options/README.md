# Optional component plans (`options/`)

This directory is the **design surface** for Ubuntu Zombie's opt-in
software components. It holds no runnable code. Each file is a written
specification for a capability that a future change could add to
[`scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh) as a public component target
with a compatible `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_<COMPONENT>` selector — off by default,
idempotent, non-interactive-capable, audited, and reversible by
[`scripts/uninstall.sh`](../scripts/uninstall.sh).

Runnable components follow the registry contract in
[`scripts/component-registry.sh`](../scripts/component-registry.sh):
isolated configuration and validators; install, verify, doctor, repair,
and uninstall hooks; explicit dependencies; target-scoped review and
dry-run rendering; component-owned receipt and manifest data; and
health-before-manifest ordering. Shared code validates dependency names
and trusted hook functions, then dispatches in registry order (reversed
for uninstall). Dependencies must be registered before their dependants,
and installing a component automatically selects its registered
dependencies. Adding a component must not change parser or dispatcher
conditionals. Environment selectors remain an additive compatibility
surface rather than the execution model.

The premise, argued in [`brainstorm.md`](brainstorm.md) and
[`docs/VISION.md`](../docs/VISION.md), is simple: once a machine carries
a private, root-capable AI Systems Administrator that can `verify`,
`doctor`, `repair`, and *explain* its own software under human approval
and audit, whole classes of software that were previously "too complex
to run unattended on a personal machine" become realistic **opt-in**
components. These plans triage and specify those candidates.

## How the files fit together

- [`brainstorm.md`](brainstorm.md) — the map of record. It catalogues
  candidate components, groups them into tiers, and carries the
  **candidate index** table that tracks each one from idea to spec. Start
  here.
- `plan-optional-<slug>.md` — one worked specification per component.
  A candidate graduates from a bullet in the brainstorm to its own plan
  file once it clears the triage bar (see below).
- [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) — the cross-cutting implementation roadmap: how to
  sequence and build these components so shared foundations land before
  the things that depend on them.

## Plans in this directory

Grouped by the operator need they serve. Every flag defaults to `0`.

### Data safety and recovery

- [`plan-optional-backup.md`](plan-optional-backup.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_BACKUP`. Scheduled `restic` snapshots of
  operator-nominated paths to an operator-supplied repository, with
  agent-assisted health checks and operator-driven restore.
- [`plan-optional-snapshots.md`](plan-optional-snapshots.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_SNAPSHOTS`. Filesystem snapshots and a pre-`apt` hook
  so a bad upgrade is one boot rollback away. Configures the distro's own
  tooling; never converts a root filesystem in place.

### Observability and self-knowledge

- [`plan-optional-observability.md`](plan-optional-observability.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_OBSERVABILITY`. A curated Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
  stack, loopback/tailnet-bound, so the agent can read its own metrics
  and logs to answer "why is the machine slow?" with evidence.
- [`plan-optional-inventory.md`](plan-optional-inventory.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_INVENTORY`. A periodic, queryable snapshot of packages,
  services, and config drift — a read-only change journal that
  complements the audit log.

### Networking and remote access

- [`plan-optional-proxy.md`](plan-optional-proxy.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_PROXY`. A host-wide `Caddy` front door that terminates
  TLS and routes to every opt-in web component from one domain.
- [`plan-optional-dns.md`](plan-optional-dns.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_DNS`. A curated single-host `Unbound` resolver with
  ad/tracker blocklists and DNS-over-TLS upstream, with health checks
  that never let DNS go dark.
- [`plan-optional-remote.md`](plan-optional-remote.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_REMOTE`. Re-introduces the full remote-access surface
  (SSH, Tailscale, `fail2ban`, `x11vnc`) as one feature-gated,
  closed-by-default component.

### Personal application stacks

- [`plan-optional-nextcloud.md`](plan-optional-nextcloud.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_NEXTCLOUD`. A single-operator Nextcloud (files, sync,
  docs) as a curated container stack with PostgreSQL, where the agent
  owns the day-2 upkeep Nextcloud is infamous for.

### Local AI / compute

- [`plan-optional-localllm.md`](plan-optional-localllm.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_LOCALLLM`. Installs and manages a local LLM runtime
  (`Ollama` by default, `llama.cpp` alternative) with optional GPU
  enablement, wired into the existing provider plumbing so the agent can
  run on a model it also maintains.

### Developer and build infrastructure

- [`plan-optional-forgejo-server.md`](plan-optional-forgejo-server.md) —
  `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_FORGEJO` (server). A self-hosted Forgejo server backed
  by PostgreSQL, with an optional local Actions runner on the same host.
- [`plan-optional-forgejo-society.md`](plan-optional-forgejo-society.md) —
  seeds the Forgejo-Society content (organisations, role repositories,
  conformance suite, workflows) **on top of** an installed Forgejo
  server. Hard-depends on the server plan.

Candidates still at the brainstorm stage — secrets manager
(`ZOMBIE_INSTALL_VAULT`), local SSO (`ZOMBIE_INSTALL_SSO`), wiki
(`ZOMBIE_INSTALL_WIKI`), curated app platform (`ZOMBIE_INSTALL_APPS`),
and registry/cache (`ZOMBIE_INSTALL_REGISTRY`) — are described in
[`brainstorm.md`](brainstorm.md) and have no plan file yet.

## The shape every plan shares

Each `plan-optional-*.md` is written against the same section order so
they can be read and reviewed uniformly:

> Goal · why AI assistance is the unlock · what "maximum" means ·
> behaviour and options · non-negotiables (from
> [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md)) · implementation steps ·
> validation before hand-off · out of scope / risks.

Every component, when built, reuses the same touch-points:

- option parsing + validators + `usage()` env block;
- an interactive parameter-review row and toggle;
- a dry-run plan and pre-flight banner lines;
- guarded install `section` blocks that check current state first
  (idempotent) and early-return when the flag is off;
- generated secrets written to root-owned files, surfaced only as
  set/unset fingerprints in the receipt;
- `verify`/`doctor`/`repair` checks that emit JSON records;
- `uninstall.sh` reversal, with destructive steps behind the
  confirmation phrase;
- a policy class in [`payload/etc/policy.yaml`](../payload/etc/policy.yaml)
  and handling in [`payload/agent/policy.py`](../payload/agent/policy.py)
  for anything the agent may later drive;
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `README.md`
  updates; a `CHANGELOG.md` entry and a `VERSION` bump.

## Naming and promotion workflow

- **One spec per file**, named `plan-optional-<slug>.md`, where `<slug>`
  is the master flag's component name in lower kebab-case
  (`ZOMBIE_INSTALL_BACKUP` → `plan-optional-backup.md`).
- A candidate graduates from a brainstorm bullet to a real spec when it
  clears the triage bar in
  [`brainstorm.md`](brainstorm.md#how-to-triage-these-into-real-plans):
  it fits the single-host, single-operator, beside-not-over model; its
  difficulty is genuinely operational; it can be expressed as the shared
  checklist above; and its blast radius is bounded and reversible.
- When a candidate is promoted, update its row in the candidate index in
  [`brainstorm.md`](brainstorm.md) to point at the new file, so the
  brainstorm stays the map of record.

## Boundaries these plans respect

Drawn from [`docs/VISION.md`](../docs/VISION.md) and
[`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md):

- **One machine, one operator, one trust boundary** — no fleet
  orchestration, no multi-tenant control planes.
- **Beside the user, not over them** — components install alongside the
  operator's session; they never replace logins, files, or the desktop.
- **Every privileged action through the policy gate and audit log** — no
  new `sudo` path bypasses the gate.
- **Idempotent, non-interactive-capable, reversible** — each component is
  one or more guarded sections, drivable end-to-end under
  `ZOMBIE_NONINTERACTIVE=1`, and undone by `uninstall.sh`.
- **No secrets in the repo; British/Commonwealth spelling; the
  `[i]/[+]/[!]/[x]` and `[ok]/[!]/[x]/[~]` glyph vocabulary.**

## Status

The **Forgejo server** plan is implemented: `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_FORGEJO`
(and `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_FORGEJO_RUNNER`) exist in `scripts/install.sh`,
together with the shared optional-component mechanism (the `9) Options`
review sub-menu, dry-run/banner/receipt stanzas, verify/doctor/repair
checks, and `uninstall.sh` reversal). See
[`plan-optional-forgejo-server.md`](plan-optional-forgejo-server.md)
for the as-built deltas and
[`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](../docs/CONFIGURATION.md#optional-components-ubuntu-zombie--options)
for operator documentation. Every other flag here remains design, not
implementation; see [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) for the recommended order.
