# Documentation index

Everything an operator, contributor, or curious reader needs, sorted
by the question they are asking. The product itself lives in
[`../payload/`](../payload/) and is delivered by
[`../scripts/install.sh`](../scripts/install.sh); start at the
top-level [`README.md`](../README.md) if you have never seen Ubuntu
Zombie before.
