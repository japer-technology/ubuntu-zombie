### Thread (5 posts)
1. Most of us own computers we can't safely operate. When something breaks, the
   gap between "it's broken" and "here's the exact fix" is a forum thread or a
   paid technician. We built Ubuntu Zombie to close that gap on the machine
   itself. 🧵
2. It adds a dedicated, root-capable Linux account — the operating identity of
   an AI Systems Administrator. You open a private chat on 127.0.0.1 and ask in
   plain language.
3. Anything privileged passes through a local policy gate and waits for YOUR
   approval before it runs. You see exactly what's proposed first.
4. Everything is audit-logged: what was asked, proposed, approved, and done.
   The only network surface is a password-protected chat on 127.0.0.1 — no
   SSH, no VNC, no inbound remote access.
5. You own the API key, the chat password, and the kill switch. It even has a
   built-in Time to Live: unless you renew it, it disables itself. `uninstall`
   reverses it. It's a transparent bash installer — inspect every line. [LINK]

### Single-feature posts (schedule across the week)
- "Preview before you commit: `install --dry-run` shows the entire plan and
  changes nothing." [SCREENSHOT]
- "`doctor` explains failures. `repair` fixes known-safe drift. `verify` is a
  read-only state check — per component." [SCREENSHOT]
- "Every action it takes is written to an audit log you can read." [SCREENSHOT]
- "No cloud key? No problem. The installer auto-detects LM Studio, Ollama, or
  llama.cpp on your LAN and runs fully offline." [SCREENSHOT]
- "It expires by design. A built-in Time to Live disables the administrator
  unless you renew it — and `/ttl --die` kills it instantly." [SCREENSHOT]
- "Optional: a self-hosted Forgejo git forge at https://your-pc.local, with
  PostgreSQL and an Actions runner. One command, fully reversible." [SCREENSHOT]
