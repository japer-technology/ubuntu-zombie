# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to look at Ubuntu Zombie.

## Ground rules

- The installer must remain idempotent. Re-running `install` must
  converge to the desired state without errors.
- The installer must work in non-interactive mode for CI.
- New external commands must be justified, version-pinned where
  practical, and retried on transient network failures.
- New privileged behaviour must go through the policy gate and the
  audit log.
- No commits of secrets, screenshots, or local state. The
  `.gitignore` already excludes the common cases.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/japer-technology/ubuntu-zombie.git
cd ubuntu-zombie
make lint     # ShellCheck + bash -n + python compile
make test     # smoke tests (no root required)
```

You need:

- `bash`, `shellcheck`, `python3` for `lint` and `test`;
- a disposable Ubuntu Desktop LTS VM for `make install-local`.

## Layout

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for components. The repository roughly mirrors
what ends up on a target machine:

```
.
├── scripts/
│   ├── install.sh                # main installer
│   └── uninstall.sh              # uninstaller

```

## Running tests

`tests/smoke.sh` runs without root and without changing system state:

- `bash -n` on the installer and every shipped shell helper;
- `python3 -m py_compile` on every shipped Python file;
- a check that the installer recognises every documented subcommand;
- a check that `ZOMBIE_NONINTERACTIVE=1` without required env exits
  with code `64`.

CI runs the same script on every push and pull request, plus
`shellcheck` on every shell file.

## Conventions

- Shell: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `set -Eeuo pipefail`, ShellCheck
  clean. Wrap long lines with `\` rather than disabling rules.
- Python: 4-space indent, type hints on public functions, no
  third-party dependencies outside what the installer already
  installs (`requests`, `pydantic`, `rich`, `typer`,
  `python-dotenv`, plus the standard library). Provider calls go
  through the Node `@earendil-works/pi-ai` bridge, not a Python SDK.
- Docs: Markdown, line-wrapped at ~78 characters where reasonable.
- Commits: imperative subject lines under 72 characters.

## Adding a provider

1. Implement `BaseProvider` in `payload/agent/providers.py`.
2. Register it in `provider_from_env()`.
3. Document the env vars in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.
4. Add a smoke test in `tests/smoke.sh` for the import.

## Adding a policy class

1. Add the class and matching patterns to `payload/etc/policy.yaml`.
2. Add a handler in `payload/agent/policy.py`.
3. Document the class in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Adding an installer component

All packaging targets use the registry helpers in
`scripts/component-registry.sh`. Registry entries contain data and trusted
function names, never executable command strings. Every registered hook is
validated with Bash function lookup before dispatch.

1. Define the component configuration and validators.
2. Implement isolated install, verify, doctor, repair, and uninstall
   lifecycle hooks.
3. Register its metadata, hooks, and explicit dependencies in registry
   order. Do not add parser or dispatcher conditionals.
4. Add manifest version data and component-owned receipt fields. Write the
   manifest only after the install and health hook succeeds.
5. Add target-scoped interactive review and dry-run rendering. An
   unselected component must never prompt or render.
6. Add policy and audit handling only when the agent can drive a new
   privileged action.
7. Add uninstall reversal plus static and hermetic tests for isolation,
   dependency validation, ordering, and sample dispatch.
8. Update operator and architecture documentation, `CHANGELOG.md`, and
   `VERSION`.

Environment selectors such as `ZOMBIE_INSTALL_FORGEJO` are compatibility
inputs that add a registry target; they are not an alternative execution
path.

## Filing an issue

Please attach a redacted diagnostic bundle when reporting installer
failures:

```bash
sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/collect-diagnostics
```
