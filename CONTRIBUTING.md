# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to look at Ubuntu Zombie.

## Ground rules

- The installer must remain idempotent. Re-running `install` must
  converge to the desired state without errors.
- The installer must work in non-interactive mode for CI.
- New external commands must be justified, version-pinned where
  practical, and retried on transient network failures.
- New privileged behaviour must go through the policy gate and the
  audit log.
- No commits of secrets, screenshots, or local state. The
  `.gitignore` already excludes the common cases.

## Local development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/japer-technology/ubuntu-zombie.git
cd ubuntu-zombie
make lint     # ShellCheck + bash -n + python compile
make test     # smoke tests (no root required)
```

You need:

- `bash`, `shellcheck`, `python3` for `lint` and `test`;
- a disposable Ubuntu Desktop LTS VM for `make install-local`.

## Layout

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for components. The repository roughly mirrors
what ends up on a target machine:

```
.
├── scripts/
│   ├── install.sh                # main installer
│   └── uninstall.sh              # uninstaller

```

## Running tests

`tests/smoke.sh` runs without root and without changing system state:

- `bash -n` on the installer and every shipped shell helper;
- `python3 -m py_compile` on every shipped Python file;
- a check that the installer recognises every documented subcommand;
- a check that `ZOMBIE_NONINTERACTIVE=1` without required env exits
  with code `64`.

CI runs the same script on every push and pull request, plus
`shellcheck` on every shell file.

## Conventions

- Shell: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `set -Eeuo pipefail`, ShellCheck
  clean. Wrap long lines with `\` rather than disabling rules.
- Python: 4-space indent, type hints on public functions, no
  third-party dependencies outside what the installer already
  installs (`requests`, `pydantic`, `rich`, `typer`,
  `python-dotenv`, plus the standard library). Provider calls go
  through the Node `@earendil-works/pi-ai` bridge, not a Python SDK.
- Docs: Markdown, line-wrapped at ~78 characters where reasonable.
- Commits: imperative subject lines under 72 characters.

## Adding a provider

1. Implement `BaseProvider` in `payload/agent/providers.py`.
2. Register it in `provider_from_env()`.
3. Document the env vars in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`.
4. Add a smoke test in `tests/smoke.sh` for the import.

## Adding a policy class

1. Add the class and matching patterns to `payload/etc/policy.yaml`.
2. Add a handler in `payload/agent/policy.py`.
3. Document the class in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Filing an issue

Please attach a redacted diagnostic bundle when reporting installer
failures:

```bash
sudo /opt/ai-zombie/bin/collect-diagnostics
```

Security issues: see `SECURITY.md` for responsible disclosure.
