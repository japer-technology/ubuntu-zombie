# Changelog

All notable changes to Ubuntu Zombie are documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added — MVP product loop
- Subcommand dispatch on `setup-part-1.sh`:
  `install`, `verify`, `doctor`, `repair`, `uninstall`.
- Separate `setup-part-1-uninstall.sh` with `--dry-run` and `--archive`
  modes that remove sudoers drop-ins, SSH drop-ins, x11vnc autostart,
  the chat systemd service, generated helpers, and (optionally) the
  `agent` user. User data under `/home/agent` and
  `/opt/ai-zombie/state/` is only deleted with explicit confirmation.
- Stronger preflight: detect free disk and memory, DNS resolution,
  `apt`/`dpkg` lock contention, conflicting display managers, public-SSH
  install path, and an existing Tailscale login.
- Retry with exponential backoff around `apt-get`, `curl`, `pip`, `npm`,
  and `playwright install`.
- `ZOMBIE_ENABLE_AUTOLOGIN` opt-in for graphical autologin (default off).
  The installer documents the trade-off and verifies the choice.
- Policy file `/etc/ubuntu-zombie/policy.yaml` with the action classes
  `read_only`, `user_change`, `system_change`, `network_change`,
  `destructive`. Defaults require approval for anything beyond read-only
  diagnostics and require an extra confirmation phrase for destructive
  actions.
- JSON-lines audit log at `/var/log/ubuntu-zombie/audit.log` with
  `logrotate` rules. Every prompt, proposed action, approval decision,
  command, exit code, and verification result is recorded. Secrets are
  redacted before logging.
- Local web chat service bound to `127.0.0.1`, served from
  `/opt/ai-zombie/agent/`. SQLite conversation history under
  `/opt/ai-zombie/state/conversations.db`. The conversation survives
  process restart.
- Provider abstraction with `openai` and `anthropic` backends, selected
  via `ZOMBIE_PROVIDER`. A clear error is raised if no provider is
  configured.
- Approval gate before privileged or destructive commands; safe-command
  runner that captures stdout, stderr, exit code, and proposed follow-up
  checks.
- systemd unit `ubuntu-zombie-chat.service` running as `agent`.
- Helper scripts under `/opt/ai-zombie/bin/`:
  - `zombie-chat` — print the chat URL and Tailscale tunnel example.
  - `audit-recent` — pretty-print recent audit entries.
  - `health-check` — single-command health summary (agent service,
    Tailscale, SSH, firewall, Docker, desktop, provider token, disk).
  - `collect-diagnostics` — collect logs and state into a redacted
    bundle in `/tmp/`.
  - `secrets-edit` — safe editor wrapper that re-asserts `0600`.
  - `doctor`, `repair` — wrappers around the installer subcommands.
- Optional systemd timer `ubuntu-zombie-health.timer` that runs
  `health-check` every 15 minutes.
- First-run status summary printed at the end of `install`, with the
  exact next command for each pending step.
- Safe example prompts shipped in `/opt/ai-zombie/agent/examples.md`
  and exposed in the chat UI.

### Added — packaging and developer ergonomics
- `VERSION` file consumed by the installer.
- `Makefile` with `lint`, `test`, `install-local`, `verify`, `package`.
- GitHub Actions CI: ShellCheck on shell scripts, `bash -n` syntax
  checks on the installer and all generated helpers, secret-pattern
  scan, Python syntax check on the chat service, and Markdown link
  sanity.
- `.gitignore` covering logs, state, screenshots, virtualenvs,
  `node_modules`, Debian build artifacts, and editor files.

### Added — documentation
- `VISION.md` — the one-sentence MVP promise.
- `QUICKSTART.md` — install in the shortest safe path.
- `CONFIGURATION.md` — provider keys, Tailscale, VNC, chat access.
- `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` — apt locks, Tailscale, Docker group, desktop
  automation, Playwright, VNC, secrets permissions.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — components and trust boundaries.
- `SECURITY.md` — trust boundary, what the provider sees, rotation,
  revocation, known risks, responsible disclosure.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — how to test and change the installer.
- `ROADMAP.md` — post-MVP ideas extracted from the possibility docs.
- README rewritten as a concise front door pointing to the new docs.

### Changed
- `setup-part-1.sh` reads the version from the `VERSION` file at the
  repository root when present.
- Graphical autologin is no longer enabled by default; the installer
  prints the recommended override when the choice matters for
  desktop-automation flows.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-Q4

### Added
- Initial proof-of-concept installer (`setup-part-1.sh`) that creates
  the `agent` user, configures passwordless sudo, hardens SSH,
  installs Tailscale + UFW, forces Xorg + autologin, installs Docker,
  Python and Node runtimes, Playwright + Chromium, GUI automation
  tools, and a loopback-only x11vnc desktop, plus an end-of-install
  verification script.
