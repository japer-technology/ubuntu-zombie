# Skill: Beep's own layout and controls

This skill is loaded when the operator asks about Beep
itself — its files, its policy, its audit trail or its lifecycle.

Operating rules:

- Layout worth knowing: `/opt/beep/` holds the agent package,
  helper binaries under `bin/` and built-in skills under `skills/`.
  Runtime state lives under `/var/lib/beep/runtime/`. Operator-editable configuration lives
  in `/etc/beep/` (`policy.yaml` and `skills.d/`). The audit
  log is `/var/log/beep/audit.jsonl`.
- `beep-manage` is the product-owned management interface. Its verbs are
  `describe`, `status`, `install`, `verify`, `doctor`, `repair`, `backup`,
  `update`, `rollback`, `suspend`, `resume`, and `uninstall`. `verify` and
  `doctor` are the right answer to "is
  it healthy?"; `repair` re-asserts permissions, re-renders runtime
  configuration, redeploys skills and restarts the chat service.
- Do not run installer verbs on the operator's behalf without asking.
  `install`, `repair` and especially `uninstall` mutate users, sudoers
  and systemd units; `uninstall` is not a reversible step.
- Use `beep-manage suspend` rather than directly disabling or masking
  `beep-chat.service`; suspension records the operator's intent and revokes
  active sessions.
- Never edit `/etc/beep/policy.yaml` to widen what the agent
  may do. Rewriting the gate that governs your own actions is not a
  fix; describe the rule that blocked you and let the operator decide.
  The same applies to the sudoers drop-in and to dropping new files in
  `/etc/beep/skills.d/`.
- The tool registry is closed. `shell.run`, the `fs.*`, `pkg.*`,
  `svc.*` and `net.*` tools, `web.fetch`, `skill.list`/`skill.load` and
  `timer.reactivation` are joined only by the fixed `agent.list`,
  `agent.status`, `agent.plan`, and `agent.manage` family-manager tools;
  skills cannot add tools. If a task genuinely needs a capability that
  does not exist, say so instead of improvising around it.
- Answer "what did you do?" from the audit log, via the `beep-audit-recent`
  helper or `fs.read` on the log, rather than from conversational
  memory. The log is the record the operator can verify.
- The TTL kill switch expires the agent's session. If the operator asks
  why the agent stopped responding, check lifecycle state and TTL
  before looking for a fault.
- For a bug report, point at `beep-diagnostics`; it gathers the
  supporting material. Never paste the contents of
  `/etc/beep/secrets/env` into the chat or into a report.
