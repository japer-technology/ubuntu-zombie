# Skill: reading and writing files

This skill is loaded when the operator asks to inspect or change files
and configuration on the machine.

Operating rules:

- Prefer `fs.read`, `fs.list` and `fs.write` over `shell.run` with
  `cat`, `ls` or `tee`. They report byte counts and truncation
  honestly, and the audit entry names the path instead of an opaque
  command string.
- `fs.read` and `fs.list` are `read_only` and cover `/etc`,
  `/var/log`, `/proc`, `/sys`, `/usr/share`, `/usr/lib`,
  `/run/systemd` and the beep state directory. Anything outside that
  set — notably `/home` — needs `shell.run`.
- The allow-list is checked against the *resolved* path, so a symlink
  that points outside the readable roots is rejected even when the link
  itself sits inside them. `/proc/<pid>/environ` is denied outright
  because it would expose the chat service's own API keys.
- `fs.write` is `user_change`, waits for approval, and can only write
  under `/tmp` and the beep state directory. It creates missing
  parent directories and replaces the file wholesale — there is no
  append and no partial edit.
- System configuration under `/etc` therefore cannot be written with
  `fs.write`. Editing it means `shell.run` with `sudo`, which is
  `system_change` or higher; read the current file first, show the
  operator the exact diff you intend, and keep the change minimal.
- Back up before editing anything the machine boots or authenticates
  with: copy to `<file>.bak-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)` and tell the
  operator the backup path so the rollback is a single command.
- Use `/tmp` for scratch work — downloads, extracted archives,
  generated files. It is the only writable general-purpose location on
  the allow-list and `shell.run`'s `cwd` is restricted to the same set.
- Read before you write, every time. Overwriting a file whose current
  contents you never inspected is how a "small fix" removes an
  operator's manual customisation.
- Validate after writing where a validator exists (`visudo -c`,
  `sshd -t`, `netplan generate`, `nginx -t`, `systemd-analyze verify`).
  A syntax error in a file that gates boot or login is expensive.
- Preserve ownership, mode, ACLs, extended attributes and symlink semantics
  when replacing an existing file. A content-correct replacement with
  different metadata can still break a service or expose a secret.
- Prefer an atomic same-filesystem replacement for complete rewrites:
  prepare and validate a temporary file, apply the intended metadata, then
  rename it over the destination. Do not truncate a live configuration
  before its replacement is known-good.
- Treat recursive copy, move, archive extraction and deletion as potentially
  destructive. Inspect source and destination, estimate size, reject paths
  that resolve unexpectedly, and never let an archive write through absolute
  paths or `..` traversal.
- Do not overwrite on name collision without explicit intent. For bulk work,
  produce a bounded preview or manifest first and verify counts, checksums or
  representative files afterward.
- Keep user files owned by the user. When privileged inspection is necessary,
  avoid leaving root-owned output in home or project directories.
